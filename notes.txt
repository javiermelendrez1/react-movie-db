hello there!

class component is the old way of making react component s
now you can do functional components

react router 
- standard in react applications for handling routes
- need for websites with many different pages 

style components good for styling react components

proptypes is great tool in react for checking props in runtime?

styled components 
- you get scoped css 
- same classnames for different components
- you can use syntax like sass
- you can props inside the styled components 


useEffect is hook you can use for sideEffects like grabbing a api 

useReducer is very similar to Redux can be used instead of useState hook

useCallback hooks used to memorize stuff if you do not want to create functions 
on re render 

useRef hook 

going to make the search bar into a controlled component
a controlled component is a component that react controls
input value is based off state

when mapping you want to use key movie.id

you can use prop type to validate that the props you are being given are of proper type
session storage only persist over a session 
local storage would be better but if the page changes dynamically it is not worth storing 


time to deploy application use netlify

in your terminal type npm run build 
will build the applcation for production

you can change code to use class components instead of functions
